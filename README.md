# 🚇Metro Ticket Management System

The Metro Ticket Management System is a console-based C application designed to simulate ticket booking and smart card management for a metro system. The project illustrates robust use of structures, pointers, linked lists, and modular programming principles for organizing real-world workflows.


✨ Features

🎟️ Ticket Booking & Passenger Records
Users can enter and store passenger details (name, age, contact, stations) through an interactive menu. Tickets are managed dynamically using linked lists for easy addition and retrieval.

💳 Smart Card Management
Recharge, add new cards, and check balances for up to 10 smart cards, using array structures and secure OTP-like verification.

📋 Menu-driven Interface
Intuitive prompts for booking tickets, viewing tickets, station and cost enquiries, train schedule, and smart card portal.

📦 Modular Code Structure
Clearly separated source files and functions for ticketing and smart card features, demonstrating maintainable C programming practices.


🏗️ Tech Stack

Language: C

Core Concepts Used:

Structures: To organize ticket and smart card data

Pointers: For efficient linked list navigation and dynamic ticket creation

Linked Lists: Implemented for managing multiple tickets

Modular Programming: Divided logic via functions and clean code separation

Standard IO: All input/output via console menus


📸 Example Usage

Start the program to see the Metro Service Menu for ticket booking, inquiries, viewing booked tickets, train schedules, and smart card management.

Book tickets by entering passenger information, stored dynamically in a linked list.

Manage your smart card by recharging, checking balance, or adding a new card, all through secure, menu-driven prompts.


📌 Future Enhancements

Add file handling for persistent ticket and smart card storage.

Improve input validation and error handling.

Expand features for route and cost queries, and enrich train schedule logic.
