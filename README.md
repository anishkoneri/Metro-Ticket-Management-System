#🚇 Metro Ticket Management System
The Metro Ticket Management System is a console-based C application designed to simulate ticket booking and smart card management for a metro system. The project illustrates robust use of structures, pointers, linked lists, and modular programming principles for organizing real-world workflows.

✨ Features

Users can enter and store passenger details (name, age, contact, stations) through an interactive menu. Tickets are managed dynamically using linked lists for easy addition and retrieval.

💳 Smart Card Management
Recharge, add new cards, and check balances for up to 10 smart cards, using array structures and secure OTP-like verification.

📋 Menu-driven Interface
Intuitive prompts for booking tickets, viewing tickets, station and cost enquiries, train schedule, and smart card portal.

📦 Modular Code Structure
Clearly separated source files and functions for ticketing and smart card features, demonstrating maintainable C programming practices.
